Suppose a person who is able to climb several steps in one go. 
This ability has led them to travel the world participating in so-called vertical races, such as the world's oldest and most famous tower race in which participants must climb the 1576 steps of the Empire State Building.
A normal person would need 1576 steps to climb all those steps. Climbing them two at a time, 788 would be enough, and three at a time only 526.
